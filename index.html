    <p> The size, structure, and navigational equipment of any vessels used in an in situ oil burn must be suited to the wind, sea state, carrying requirements, and visibility conditions expected during the burn operation. For operations on the open water, vessels should have a reliable positioning system, such as GPS, a compass or gyrocompass, working radar, working depth sounder, HF radio, VHF radio, and telephone.

Under the Canada Shipping Act, each vessel is legally required to have the appropriate safety equipment in accordance with the size and type of vessel and the type of operation being undertaken. This includes life boats, life rafts, life-saving rings, flares, firefighting equipment, life jackets, survival suits, and navigation lights.

Any vessel chartered in Canada or the United States should possess a valid Coast Guard inspection certificate. A survey by a qualified ship surveyor or naval architect is recommended before chartering a vessel. The Ship Safety Branch of the Canadian Coast Guard should be consulted for more information about these requirements.</p></section>
